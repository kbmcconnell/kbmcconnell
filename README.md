### Well, hello there!

I'm a passionate software engineer based out of Seattle, WA. I have a Bachelor of Science degree from Seattle University and two years of frontend and full stack development experience. My first solo project was the implmentation of [neuross.org](https://www.neuross.org/), which is currently in its MVP state. I designed it using Figma, wrote it in React JS, and deployed it using Netlify. We are migrating NSS over to Squarespace where I will add further customization and improve its overall design.

I have a wide range of interests and hobbies which I could definitely talk your ear off about. In typical PNW fashion, I'm fond of hiking, backpacking, kayaking, and just being outside in general. I even did a 6 day hiking trip when I traveled to Scotland in September 2022. I absolutely cried. 

I also enjoy reading and writing - I used to be a music writer where I reviewed albums, interviewed musicians, and did concert reviews. I'm cited in Wikipedia over 30 times. In my free time I write fiction and poetry. My favorite genres to read and write are sci-fi and fantasy. Ursula K Le Guin is my all-time favorite author and I highly recommend everyone check her out.

As you may have guessed by now, I am a massive nerd with a modest comic book collection and a weird amount of astronomy knowledge. Feel free to ask me about it!

### In Progress Projects

I'm currently working on updating an old college project called SpacePlace - it's a space-focused social place that allows users to find upcoming astronomical events in their area. I will update with a url once it's been deployed.

I will be re-writing and sharing various data structures I've worked on in C++. Like Linked Lists, Hash Tables, and so on.

### Languages and Frameworks

Javascript, Typescript, C++, Python, SQL, NoSQL

**Frameworks:**

**Misc:**
